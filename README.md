# Overview 
This project develops a data-driven tool for real-time detection and quantification of multidimensional poverty across all 32 Mexican states. By leveraging text-rich data from social media platforms and news outlets, the tool bridges the gap between outdated official statistics and real-time needs, enabling more timely and targeted social interventions.

This work is part of a thesis project aimed at developing a robust method for nowcasting poverty across its multiple dimensions, enabling prompt and precisely-targeted interventions. This research addresses a critical need in the Mexican context, where extensive literature demonstrates that drug cartels exploit and thrive in areas with persistent structural problems, including poverty, inequality, and lack of state presence.

# Motivation
Traditional poverty estimation methods rely on infrequent surveys and outdated data. Mexico's latest official multidimensional poverty statistics date back to 2022, creating a significant lag in understanding current socioeconomic conditions. Additionally, the high presence of illegal activities and structural problems makes traditional quantification challenging.
This tool addresses the need for:
- Real-time insights into poverty dynamics
- Early warning systems for deteriorating conditions
- Enhanced intervention targeting based on current data
